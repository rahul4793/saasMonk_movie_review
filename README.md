### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:

   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@localhost:5432/DATABASE_NAME
   PORT=5000
   In hurry to submit I have hard coded Backend URL on render it will work locally also because my backend is deployed on render
   If you want you can uncomment the localhost codes
   ```

   Replace `USER`, `PASSWORD`, and `DATABASE_NAME` with your PostgreSQL credentials.

4. Run database migrations (make sure you have the Prisma schema set up):

   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate dev
   ```
